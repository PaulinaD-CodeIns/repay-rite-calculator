### RepayRite - Mortgage Repayment Calculator

RepayRite is a Python-based mortgage repayment calculator designed to help users manage and better understand their loan repayment scenarios. With this tool, users can:

1. Calculate the current repayment schedule and estimate the overall redemption amount of their mortgage.
2. Explore the impact of extra payments by seeing how additional contributions affect the monthly repayment and loan term.
3. Evaluate refinancing options by simulating the effect of adjusting the interest rate on the loan term and total repayable amount.

The program utilises the following mortgage repayment formula to provide accurate calculations:

M = P * (r * (1 + r)**n) / ((1 + r)**n - 1)
